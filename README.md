Smart Traffic Management System
Overview
The Smart Traffic Management System is a microservice-based application designed to predict dangerous driving behaviors and detect vehicle overloads. This project leverages Spring Boot, Redis, Kafka, and PyTorch for building a real-time traffic management system. It includes an ML model trained using RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) to predict dangerous driving patterns based on sensor data.

Features
Real-time vehicle data processing: Integration with Kafka to handle real-time data streams.
Dangerous driving prediction: Machine learning models to predict dangerous driving behaviors (e.g., aggressive driving).
Overload detection: Using sensor data to detect if a vehicle is overloaded.
Redis caching: Efficient data caching using Redis for low-latency data access.
Scalable microservice architecture: Built using Spring Boot, making it easy to scale and manage.
Technology Stack
Backend Framework: Spring Boot (Java)
Machine Learning: PyTorch (Python)
Message Broker: Apache Kafka
Data Caching: Redis
Build Tool: Maven
Model Type: RNN/GRU for time-series analysis
Deployment: Docker, Flask (for the Python ML service)
Architecture
Java Microservice: Handles Kafka integration, Redis caching, and business logic.
Python Microservice: Hosts the ML model for prediction and analysis, accessible via Flask APIs.
Kafka: Used for streaming sensor data, ensuring scalability and reliability in real-time environments.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Java 17 (for Spring Boot backend)
Python 3.8+ (for ML model and Flask API)
Maven (for building the Java project)
Redis (for caching)
Kafka (for message streaming)
Docker (for containerization, optional)
Steps to Setup
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LookJohnny/smart-traffic-project.git
cd smart-traffic-project
2. Setting up the Java backend
Install dependencies and build the project using Maven:

mvn clean install
Run the Spring Boot microservice:

mvn spring-boot:run
3. Setting up the Python Machine Learning service
Navigate to the smart-traffic-ml directory:

cd smart-traffic-ml
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask server for the ML service:

python app.py
4. Running Kafka and Redis (using Docker)
Start Redis:

docker run -p 6379:6379 redis
Start Kafka (via Docker or manually):

docker-compose up
5. Testing the API
Once both the Java and Python services are running, you can test the API via:

The Spring Boot backend at http://localhost:8080.
The Flask ML service at http://localhost:5000/predict.
Usage
The system reads real-time sensor data (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope) from Kafka.
The Spring Boot backend manages the data flow and communicates with the PyTorch model via the Flask API to predict driving behavior.
Redis is used for caching processed data to improve performance.
API Endpoints
POST /predict: Sends time-series sensor data to the Python Flask API for analysis.
GET /vehicles: Retrieves vehicle data from Redis.
Machine Learning Model
Model Architecture: A deep learning model utilizing GRU to process time-series data from sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes.
Training Dataset: The model is trained on labeled driving behavior data (e.g., NORMAL, AGGRESSIVE).
Input: Sensor data (AccX, AccY, AccZ, GyroX, GyroY, GyroZ) collected over time windows.
Output: Probability of dangerous driving behavior or vehicle overload.
Future Improvements
Model Optimization: Improve the accuracy of the ML model using more advanced techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.
Real-time Scaling: Implement horizontal scaling for handling higher traffic volumes using Kubernetes.
Edge Deployment: Explore deploying parts of the system on edge devices for faster real-time predictions.
